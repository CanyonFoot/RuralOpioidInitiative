# Walmart Data

The data was extracted by Angela Hetrick from OSU and uploaded into github by SShrestha.

What is included in the folder
•	Walmart excel file with full details, including addresses
•	Walmart excel file with state FIP codes, and a column that indicates if a Walmart is present in the state. (All states have at least one Walmart)
•	Walmart excel file with county FIP codes, I’ve left duplicates, so there may be multiple rows for several counties. If a county FIP code is not listed, that indicates no open Walmart location in that county.
•	Walmart excel file with zip codes; same criteria as in the county file.

Data from:
